# Letter-Grader
This is a program that determines the letter grade of students using class, objects, exception handling, and collection in Java

This program accepts two command line arguments. The first argument will be the name of a disk file that contains the names of students, and their test scores, separated by commas followed by one or more spaces. Each line in the file will contain scores for one student. The second argument will be the name of an output disk file. This program will create a new output disk file using that name. The output file will have grade information of all students whose information was read from input file, in a sorted order. This program will be writing one line in the output file for one student. It will write name of one student and the letter grade he/she got in the class in each line (texts are formatted in the output file). The format of the data in the input file is fixed, however the number of students in the input file is unknown during compile time. The name of input and output files could be anything and only known during run time. Besides writing to the output file, this program also displays the averages of scores along with minimum and maximum scores for each test in the screen/console.
